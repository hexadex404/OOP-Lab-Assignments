Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

It's a pass by value programming language.


1. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?

Because Java is a pass by value programming language, the method swap() only swaps the references of the local variables jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, not the actual values they refer to.
 

2. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

The title jungleDVD is changed to the new title passed as an argument to the method, then the old title is stored in a local variable called oldTitle. A new DVD object is created with the old title, but this does not affect the original DVD object passed in as a parameter. It only creates a new DVD object that is not referenced by any variable.
